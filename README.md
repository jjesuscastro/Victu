# Victu

## Project Overview
Victu is an application wherein Canteens can schedule their weekly meals for students to
purchase. Farmers can list down ingredients they can supply to canteens which are visible
when canteens set up their recipes as a suggestion where they can source their supply.
Consumers can then view from a weekly menu wherein they can reserve meals for set times.
